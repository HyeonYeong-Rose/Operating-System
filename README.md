# Operating-System

## DiningPhilosopher
- Consider the potential for a deadlock
- Each philosopher has a single chopstick and is waiting infinitely for the second one. 

## Equation_Calculator
- An algorithm to calculate two polynomials

## PIDManager 
- Assign unique PIDs to many threads

- The trouble spots in completing this assignment
    - In implemeting the getPIDWait in the PIDTest, there was a trouble about the order of codes. I could adjust the order by testing many cases with much efforts such as inserting the test print out in each phases. 
- What I learned
    - I thought I was familiar with JAVA, but I realized that I need for efforts to practice the way of using objective features in JAVA such as making the new object from the interface. By designing and testing the interface, I could learn how to use the objects and functions efficiently.

## SimpleShell
- Implement the CMD itself through JAVA code
